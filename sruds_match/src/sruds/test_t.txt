Then Jesus answering said unto them,
Go your way, and tell John what things ye
have seen and heard; how that the blind
see, the lame walk, the lepers are
cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are
raised, to the poor the gospel is
preached. And blessed is he, whosoever shall
not be offended in me.And when the messengers of John
were departed, he began to speak unto the
people concerning John, What went ye out
into the wilderness for to see? A reed
shaken with the wind.But what went ye out for to see? A
man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they
which are gorgeously apparelled, and live
delicately, are in kings' courts.But what went ye out for to see? A
prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much
more than a prophet.This is he, of whom it is written,
Behold, I send my messenger before thy
face, which shall prepare thy way before
thee.For I say unto you, Among those that
are born of women there is not a greater
prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is
least in the kingdom of God is greater than
he.
