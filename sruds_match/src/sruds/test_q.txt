lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and

and the poor have the gospel preached to
them.

not be offended in me.
11:7: And as they departed, Jesus began to
say unto the multitudes concerning John,
What went ye out into the wilderness to
see? A reed shaken with the wind?
11:8: But what went ye out for to see? A
man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they
that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.
11:9: But what went ye out for to see? A
prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more
than a prophet.
11:10: For this is he, of whom it is written,
Behold, I send my messenger before thy
face, which shall prepare thy way before
thee.
11:11: Verily I say unto you, Among them
that are born of women there hath not risen
a greater than John the Baptist:
not withstanding he that is least in the
kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
